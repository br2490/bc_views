## What is it?
The purpose of this module is to allow archivists & curators to create a collection view by way of using a SOLR query.

It makes the process of displaying collections (e.g., special collections, timely collections, unique collections, any combination of the above) easy, and promotes the end-user to explore within that collection (searching and faceting work).

## How do I use it?
- Install it like any other Drupal module.
- Click Content and add new content using the Barnard Collection View.
- Specify the base SOLR query that will generate the collection view, write your descriptions, yada yada...

## Why?
This module only uses core Drupal 1.7x functionality and promotes the display of collections.

It includes the ability of end users to search and facet the collection view without being redirected.
